I am currently a PhD student at [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/) of [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Shinji Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/view/shinjiwatanabe). In 2019-2020, I was a PhD student in [CLSP](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/).

Previously, I was a member of [X-LANCE Lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/), working with [Dr. Yanmin Qian](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yanmin-qian) and [Dr. Kai Yu](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/members/kai_yu). I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

You can find my Curriculum Vitae [here](https://simpleoier.github.io/assets/pdf/Curriculum_Vitae_General.pdf).

My research focuses on machine learning and its applications in speech processing. I am interested in the **Cocktail Party Problem**, aiming at building an end-to-end speech recognition system for speech mixtures of multiple sources.

##### Research Directions
- Speech recognition for single-speaker or multi-speaker
- Speech separation
- Speech translation
